# hselection
This program demonstrates some of how to use Haskell's monad transformers.
It shows bugs that mutate over time, plants that the bugs eat, spiders that attack the bugs, and a log of events that appears on the right.
This demonstrates the kind of complexity that monad transformers can help deal with.
